Five important considerations for wire framing:

1 - Clarify the problem
Ask stakeholders:
- What is the project?
- What problem is it solving?
- How do we know it's a problem?
- Who is it for?
- Where is this page or tool going to live?
Before you start planning a solution, know the problem.

2 - Workflows and Sketches
Sketching can happen anywhere, anytime. Sketching with stakeholders early on is a great way to talk through the problem and workflow. Pinning down the workflow and necessary screens will streamline the process.

3 - Get Feedback (Early)
Show developers, designers, and product managers a possible solution. It helps incorporate and consider the technical limitations and other unforeseen capabilities. Also helps with developing a timeframe for building a solution.

4 - Know Your Tools

5 - Know Your Audience
Fidelity of wireframes has to be tailored to your audience. High-fidelity wireframes for those who needed to see the concept fleshed out as close to reality as possible. Low-fidelity wireframes for those who simply wanted to know where the interactive elements were with a description of how they worked.
